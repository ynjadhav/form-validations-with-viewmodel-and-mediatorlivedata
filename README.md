# Key Features:

ViewModel Architecture: The repository utilizes the ViewModel architecture component, which separates the UI logic from the data layer. This promotes a clean and maintainable codebase and allows for easy unit testing.

MediatorLiveData: MediatorLiveData is employed to observe changes in multiple input fields simultaneously. It dynamically updates the validation state based on user input and triggers UI updates accordingly.

Real-time Validation: The repository implements real-time validation for each form field, providing instant feedback to users as they fill out the form. Validation rules can be easily customized and expanded to meet specific requirements.

Sample Application: The repository provides a sample Android application that showcases the implementation of form data validations using ViewModel and MediatorLiveData. The sample app serves as a practical reference for integrating the solution into existing projects.

With this repository, Android developers can easily integrate form data validations into their applications using ViewModel and MediatorLiveData. By leveraging the power of these architecture components, developers can enhance the user experience, streamline input handling, and ensure data integrity in their forms.

Note: This repository is intended to be used as a reference and starting point for implementing form data validations using ViewModel and MediatorLiveData. It is adaptable and can be customized to meet the specific needs of different Android projects.
